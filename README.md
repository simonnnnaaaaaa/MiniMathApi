# 🧮 MiniMathAPI – FastAPI Microservice

A lightweight microservice that exposes mathematical operations (`pow`, `fib`, `factorial`) via a REST API. All requests are logged in a SQLite database.

The service uses Pydantic for validation, includes request-level caching, multithreading for CPU-bound operations, and Prometheus-compatible monitoring at `/metrics`. The application is containerized with Docker and deployed using Rancher.

## ▶️ Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t minimathapi .
docker run -p 8000:8000 minimathapi
```
